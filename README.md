## Introduction

In this repository, we demonstrate the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentiment Analysis to get the sentiment score for popular companies on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) discussion forums. We use pretrained models from [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) for [NER](https://spacy.io/models/en) and [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) for Sentiment Analysis.
